## Get access to the DeepL API

To use the DeepL API, you'll need an account and an API key. [You can create an account here](https://www.deepl.com/pro?utm_source=github&utm_medium=github-awesome-deepl#developer). With a DeepL API Free account, you can translate up to 500,000 characters per month for free.

## Awesome DeepL 
Inspired by [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) and by [awesome-go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go).

The DeepL community has contributed to a remarkable array of open-source projects. In recognition of these contributions, we have curated an "Awesome DeepL" list on GitHub, providing a dedicated space to showcase these outstanding projects.
